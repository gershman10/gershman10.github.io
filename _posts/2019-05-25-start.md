To get your start in what you really want to acheive in life, you need to start doing what you really want in life. There can be no substitute. Whether what you want is very clear and tangible to you, a vague feeling you barely understand that comes when you do certain things, or something completely unknown to you; to get there, you start by starting. 

To substitute is to lie to yourself, to lie to yourself is to confuse yourself, and to confuse yourself is to lose your clarity. Start. Let nothing distract you.

Comfort is decadence. Decadence is decay. When you free yourself from the cling to immediate comfort, the fear of discomfort, taking the first step becomes more and more of a matter of course.

Don't delude yourself with grandeur. Creation does not concern itself with fame, wealth, or power in the moment of creativity. The craving for these things creates sweet discord. When under the influence of inspiration, don't let them stifle you.

Don't get caught in the false dichotomy of ideal and practical. Both are real. This dichotomy is imbued with the failures of those who've created and perpetuate it.

Start. Free yourself. Ask for help, and help those who also want to start. Let the illusive hurdles inhibiting you fade, and reclaim that which is yours. We're waiting patiently.
